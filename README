1. About the Script

lite2do-irssi is  a lightweight todo manager  for Irssi  written in Perl 5.
Being based  on w2do  and fully compatible  with its  save file format,  it
tries to provide a simple alternative for IRC network capable of collabora-
tive task management.


2. Script Usage

Unless set otherwise,  everyone is granted  an unlimited access to the task
list from both public channel and private query using a command in the fol-
lowing format:

  :todo COMMAND [ARGUMENT...]

Alternatively,  if you are running the script in your client,  you can also
use an Irssi command:

  /todo COMMAND [ARGUMENT...]

Available commands are as follows:

  list [@GROUP] [TEXT...]
  ls [@GROUP] [TEXT...]
    Display items in the task list.  Desired subset can be  easily selected
    giving a group name, text pattern,  or combination of both; listing all
    tasks is usually disabled to avoid unnecessary flood.

  list %ID
  ls %ID
    Display task with selected id.

  add [@GROUP] TEXT...
    Add new item to the task list.

  change ID TEXT...
  mv ID TEXT...
    Change item with selected id in the task list.

  change ID @GROUP
  mv ID @GROUP
    Change group the item with selected id belongs to.

  finish ID
  fn ID
    Mark item with selected id as finished.

  revive ID
  re ID
    Mark item with selected id as unfinished.

  remove ID
  rm ID
    Remove item with selected id from the task list.

  help [COMMAND]
    Display usage information.  By default,  list of all supported commands
    is displayed. If  the command is supplied,  further  information on its
    usage are displayed instead.

  version
    Display version information.


3. Additional Tools

Sooner or later, you are going to notice that lite2do-irssi lacks some more
sophisticated commands that might prove useful for administration purposes,
such as operations on whole groups, mass removal of finished tasks, or even
clearing the task list. This is not a design flaw. On the contrary, follow-
ing the  principle not to reinvent  the wheel,  the use of w2do is strongly
advised.

w2do is a simple to use yet efficient command-line todo manager  written in
Perl 5 on which the lite2do-irssi is based,  and you can freely download it
from <http://w2do.blackened.cz/>.
